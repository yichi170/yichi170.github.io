# About Me
---
I'm currently a master's student in Computer Science at The University of Texas at Austin. I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, advised by Prof. Yung-Ju Chang. Also, I was a software intern in the compiler team at SiFive from Fall 2022 to Fall 2023, working on compiler performance analysis.
