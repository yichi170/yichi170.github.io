# About Me
---

Hi! I'm Yi-Chi Lee (李懿麒), a Master's student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/">the University of Texas at Austin</a>, expecting to graduate in May 2026. I'm passionate about compiler development and system software and am currently **seeking full-time opportunities** in these areas.

\
I recently interned at <a href="https://www.amd.com/https://www.amd.com/">AMD</a>, where I explored integrating machine learning into compiler optimizations. I designed a custom instruction scheduling strategy in the LLVM AMDGPU backend that can interact with an external model during compilation, enabling the compiler to incorporate learned decision-making. Earlier, I interned on the compiler team at <a href="https://www.sifive.com/">SiFive</a>, where I built tools to evaluate the effectiveness of compiler optimizations. Beyond internships, I’ve developed projects such as an operating system for Raspberry Pi and a compiler for RISC-V.

\
During my undergrad, I was a research assistant at the Mobile and Ubiquitous Interaction Lab under <a href="https://armuro.info/">Prof. Yung-Ju Chang</a>, focusing on intelligent notification systems. I built an Android notification system to study how AI may improve user interaction with notifications. This research led to publications in HCI conferences.

\
I'm actively involved in extracurricular activities. I have organized film festivals, hosted a podcast discussing cinema, and led student organizations, enriching my university experience through leadership and community engagement.
